nickel-based monolithic SiC catalysts for SMR. In this work, a structured monolithic catalyst support has been
formed by a modified freeze-gelation method, initially starting from SiC powder, and nickel has been distributed
to form a monolithic nickel-based catalyst by wet impregnation. The results showed that the catalysts can
achieve thermodynamic equilibrium at 600 ◦C with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 10,000 h (cid:0)1, while
reaching a high methane conversion of 86% at 800 ◦C and GHSV value of 20,000 h (cid:0)1 during the performance
tests using low feeding concentration and low pressure. This is the first time SiC catalytic materials have had
their performance demonstrated for SMR under realistic operating conditions.

3.1. Characterisation of catalysts
3.1.1. Volumetric density of monoliths and nickel loading
The fresh SiC ceramic support (SiC-M) was grey in appearance with
pores and channels visible on the surface, and after impregnation it
maintained its shape but the colour darkened slightly. The SiC-M can
float on the surface of DI water as the volumetric density of SiC-M was
found to be 0.33±0.014g/cm3, which was about one third of water
(0.997g/cm3 at 25◦C).
Table 2 shows the amount of nickel oxide coated on the surface of
monoliths for two different precursor concentrations used for further
tests. The nominal nickel contents are equal to the concentration of
nickel precursor used for impregnation. For 20Ni/SiC-M, 3 samples were
prepared and used to calculated absolute nickel loading. The nickel
loading was 0.41±0.018g (in NiO) and 21.4±0.5% (in wt% NiO).
These results showed that the applied wet impregnation method was
able to distribute nickel on the surface of SiC-M steadily. However, it
was difficult to achieve the same loading of nickel in impregnation so-
lution when it was used to prepare 10Ni/SiC-M and 2Ni/SiC-M.

fact, the GHSV value is zero for this thermodynamic equilibrium sce-
nario, and the 20Ni/SiC-M catalysts exhibited a thermodynamic-level
performance for carbon conversion, and it is not worthy decreasing
GHSV further to get closer to equilibrium as it would only achieve a
minor improvement.
The GHSV describes how fast the gaseous reactants passed through
the catalytic monolith, at higher GSHV’s, the residence time is lower and
there will be less chance that the active sites on surface of the material
were used as there was a reduced frequency of successful collisions, and
unreacted gas will pass through unreacted. This can explain the
increasing of carbon conversion when GHSV was reduced, as more
methane and steam molecules reacted over a longer contact time.
Esteves et al. studied the influence of space velocity for methane
decomposition reaction over CoMo/MgO catalyst, and they found the
similar trends for methane conversion as the contact time between gas
and catalyst were small when space velocity was high [41]. The final
state of carbon and hydrogen is contingent on the balance between SMR
and WGS (Eqs. (1) and (2)) and the properties of catalysts. The selec-

final state of carbon and hydrogen but also the methane conversion. The
hydrogen selectivity will not be shown a significant variation when
hydrogen is the predominant gas in exhaust gas, as similar scenario was

(x=2, 10, 20) are shown in Fig. 9, in terms of methane conversion vs
temperature, hydrogen yield vs temperature, hydrogen selectivity vs
temperature and carbon monoxide (CO) selectivity vs temperature. For
all samples tested, 20Ni/SiC-M was chosen to evaluate the standard
deviation of monoliths’ structural and textural properties by three rep-
etitions using different 20Ni/SiC-M catalysts.
These results highlight how the SiC monolithic catalysts perform
under SMR conditions from 600◦C to 800◦C: both higher methane
conversion and hydrogen yield were found when operating temperature
rose. For the reference sample 20Ni/SiC-M, the highest methane con-
version obtained was about 86% with a highest hydrogen yield of over
68%, both were observed at 800◦C. When the reaction temperature was
between 650◦C and 750◦C, it seems to have a similar carbon conversion
and hydrogen yield which was around 80% and 66%, respectively.
These results were proved to be precise as the low standard deviations
was obtained. The activities of 20Ni/SiC-M were not far from the
equilibrium values, as the differences were 7–18% for methane con-
versions and 9–18% for hydrogen yields. The equilibrium data were
obtained via FactSage software applying a batch condition with the
presence of 1mol of methane and 3 moles of steam under a total pres-
sure of 1bar.
When reaction temperature rose, hydrogen selectivity decreased
slightly and the average value was around 78%. These data highly

4. Conclusions
Structured monolithic SiC catalysts with 2–20wt% of nickel loading
were prepared by a modified freeze-gelation and wet impregnation
methods. Catalytic performance tests at severe but realistic conditions
(10,000–25,000h (cid:0) 1 of GHSV, 1bar of pressure and 10% CH4 balanced
with N2 as the feed) were performed in the temperature range of
600–800◦C. The results showed that the 20Ni/SiC-M catalysts exhibited
a high catalytic activity, especially at low SMR temperatures, compared
with other SiC supported nickel-based catalysts. It achieved CH4 equi-
librium conversion at 600◦C, S:C=3, GHSV=10,000h (cid:0) 1. The struc-
tural and textural properties of the SiC-M catalyst support, such as
porosity, had a positive effect on mass and heat transfer which
contributed to its excellent performance at low operating temperature.
There are still some challenges focusing on the deactivation of the cat-
alysts as nickel-based catalysts were reported to suffer from coke for-
mation [45]. Long-term test regarding with the investigation of catalyst
stability and coke resistance are still interesting to be carried out, to
