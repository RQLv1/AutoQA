Keywords: The one-pot CO2 hydrogenation to lower olefins involves the integration of two catalytic reactions in a single
CCU reactor: the conversion of CO2 into methanol (CTM) and its subsequent conversion into lower olefins (MTO). This
CO2 hydrogenation approach requires two catalysts cooperating in the same reactor, posing different challenges in terms of synergies

Both in the case of the MM and of the CB runs, control points were
taken in the same reference conditions (GHSV =3L(STP)/h/g, T =380
◦C, P =38barg) to evidence variations in the system behavior. In the
case of the MM (Fig. 1A), when the control point is replicated at ToS
270–320h, the CO2 conversion is still very close to the value predicted
by thermodynamics, while the selectivity is changed: CO selectivity is
higher, reaching 75%; and the O/P ratio is higher as well, getting close
to 1. The replicated point seem to match well with the progression of the
selectivity trends observed in the first 100h on stream, suggesting a
slow, but constant deactivation. In the case of the CB run (Fig. 1B) the
replicated control points at ToS =175 – 265h and 430 – 450h perfectly
replicated the initial point in terms of conversion and selectivity. In fact,
at these conditions the RWGS reaction is dominating, and closely
approaching the thermodynamic equilibrium: this makes the identifi-
cation of eventual differences in catalytic activity very challenging, and
more information on the system stability can be obtained by charac-
terizing the spent samples.

sion despite the increased methanol consumption. Since every mol of
CH3OH converted into hydrocarbons leads to the formation of a mol of
H2O, this contributes to the maintenance of the equilibrium and con-
stant CO2 conversion [26].
Upon increasing the separation between the CTM and MTO catalysts
by introducing α-Al2O3 in the mechanical mixture (DMM in Fig. 2), only
minor effects are observed with respect to the undiluted mechanical
mixture (MM); the DMM resulted in the lowest CO selectivity (55%) but
also in the highest CH4 and C2+ paraffins selectivity (8 and 25%,
respectively). This indicates that the beneficial effect of the SAPO-34
proximity is still in place, as the results are much closer to the ones
obtained in the case of the mechanical mixture rather than the consec-
utive bed (compare CB, DMM and MM columns in Fig. 2). We speculate
that the different product distribution could be explained by the pres-
ence of a mild acidity of the α-Al2O3 diluent, as the increased presence of
surface acidity can lead to secondary hydrogenations, thus lowering
lower olefins selectivity [41]. When considering the RWGS reaction, the
Kp/Keq in this case is equal to 0.91. This value is still substantially close
to the value of 1, indicating that the reaction is very close to being
equilibrated. We explain the small deviation from the equilibrium with
the increased selectivity towards methane observed when testing the
DMM.
Since a synergistic effect between the catalysts was observed in terms
of product distribution, the In2O3-ZrO2 and SAPO-34 were mixed
together in a mortar to obtain a more intimate contact between the two
phases (IM column in Fig. 2). In this case we obtained very poor results
in terms of product selectivity, leading to a CO selectivity of nearly 95%
with a selectivity towards C1+products below 1%. Despite the increased
contact between the two catalysts that is expected to favor methanol

3.6. In2O3-ZrO2 to SAPO-34 ratio effect in the mechanical mixture
Given that the most promising performances were obtained by a
mechanical mixture of In2O3-ZrO2 and SAPO-34, we decided to vary the
relative ratio of the two materials. Considering the In2O3-ZrO2:SAPO-34
1:1wt ratio as our benchmark, the tests were carried out by keeping
constant the amount of In2O3-ZrO2 (and hence the inlet flowrate and the
GHSV, as it is defined in this work per gram of In2O3-ZrO2 catalyst only)
and varying the amount of zeolite catalyst to obtain In2O3-ZrO2:SAPO-
34 ratios equal to 1:0.3 and 1:2. In this way it is possible to vary the
contact time over the MTO catalyst while working at constant contact
time over the CTM catalyst. The trends of CO2 conversion and C-selec-
tivity for the three mechanical mixtures are reported Fig. 8 for the first
70h on stream at 380 ◦C. The reader is referred to the experimental
section for a detailed description of the start-up procedure.
On all mechanical mixtures CO2 conversion is stable after around
10h, and then remains constant as the C-containing products rearrange
before reaching stability after about 50h on stream. CO selectivity is
initially decreasing, reaches a minimum value when CO2 conversion is
approaching stability and progressively grows at higher ToS. This trend
is more pronounced as the amount of SAPO-34 increases in the me-
chanical mixture, given that CO selectivity is strongly affected by the
relative ratio between the CTM and MTO catalysts.
Concerning the C-selectivity towards lower olefins and the corre-
sponding paraffins, some differences can be pointed out as well. In the
case of the mechanical mixture with the lower In2O3-ZrO2/SAPO-34
ratio (1:0.3wt, Fig. 8A) olefins are always produced in higher quantity
with respect to paraffins. At the beginning of the test, olefin selectivity
goes through a maximum after about 10h, in correspondence to the
minimum CO selectivity. However, the O/P ratio remains very similar
throughout the experiment (around 2.7). As the MTO/CTM catalyst ratio
increases (In2O3-ZrO2/SAPO-34wt ratio equal to 1:1 and 1:2 in Figs. 8B
and 8C, respectively) the olefin and paraffin selectivity show more
marked variations with ToS: not only paraffins are always more abun-
dant than olefins, but in these cases paraffins show a maximum in cor-
respondence to the minimum of CO selectivity. As CO selectivity
increases, the olefin and paraffin trends tend to converge, until an O/P
ratio approaching 1 in the case of the 1:1wt mixture (Fig. 8B, ToS =
60h) and 1.5 in the case of the 1:2wt mixture (Fig. 8C). In this latter
case the maximum in paraffin selectivity is more evident and occurs at
the beginning of the run, almost in the absence of olefins production.
In general, it is evident that the initiation of olefin production starts
at later ToS as the zeolite load increases. This can be explained by
considering that the MTO reaction requires an induction time before
becoming effective. In fact, aromatic species need to be formed within
the zeolite cages for the MTO reaction to proceed effectively, and by
increasing the amount of available zeolite, the time required to accu-
mulate enough aromatics increases.
To compare more effectively the performances of the three me-
chanical mixtures, the averaged points collected after ToS >60h shown
in Fig. 8 are compared in Fig. 9.
As previously observed when comparing different arrangements
between In2O3-ZrO2 and SAPO-34 in Fig. 6, also in this case all tested
mechanical mixtures show minor variations in CO2 conversion in the
presence of significant variations in product selectivity.

but the increased SAPO-34 content causes a decrease in the O/P ratio, as
most of the produced hydrocarbons are in the form of paraffins. The
lower CO and higher hydrocarbon selectivity agrees with the beneficial
effect of the methanol removal by the MTO catalyst that we have

required to form the extra CH3OH, as well as the additional H2O for-
mation coming from the MTO reaction. In other words, CH3OH con-
sumption is not fast enough compared to the RWGS. With this in mind, it
is unsurprising that by lowering the SAPO-34 content CO2 conversion
remains unchanged, as in this way we are decreasing the contact time
over the MTO catalyst, and hence the extent of the CH3OH consumption
reaction. It is more surprising that even by doubling the amount of MTO
catalyst with the 1:2 mixture, where CH3OH consumption reaction
proceeds faster as indicated by the higher hydrocarbon content, the CO2
conversion still remains chained to the equilibrium value. By increasing
the zeolite content (i.e. increasing CH3OH removal) at the same process
conditions it should be eventually possible to overcome the equilibrium
value of ~35%; however, as the zeolite mass increases the MTO reac-
tivity becomes more and more selective towards paraffins thus making
the process less appealing.
4. Conclusions
The effect of different In2O3-ZrO2 and SAPO-34 arrangements in the
CO2 to olefins reaction have been investigated in this paper. An inter-
mediate distance between CTM and MTO catalysts, achieved using a
mechanical mixture of powdered catalysts, offered promising perfor-
mances. In fact, when the contact is too intimate or too loose the reac-
tion brings mainly to CO, with paraffins dominating the hydrocarbon
pool. The relative amount of In2O3-ZrO2 and SAPO-34 can steer the
product selectivity: increasing the quantity of SAPO-34 lowers CO
selectivity and enhances MeOH production, leading to higher hydro-
carbon yields. However, the longer residence time of the MeOH in the
